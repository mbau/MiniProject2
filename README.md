Completed Mini Project 2. 

Project requirements can be found here: http://www3.nd.edu/~cse/2013fa/40814/projects.html

Project Requirements:

In the second mini project, we teach our app how to find its location. For this, you need to utilize the device's positioning features (which uses GPS, Wi-Fi localization, etc., as shown in class). However, getting the location is actually the easy part; the fun part is what you do with it. In this assignment, you take the code from the first project and add the following minimum features:
Add positioning features such that the app can determine its own location.
A map feature that shows your location on the map. The map should allow zooming in and out.
The ability to display additional features such as locations of hotels, restaurants, etc. For this you will most likely need to use a third-party API such as Google Places API. Ideally you can tell the app which "places" to show if any.
The ability to pin locations on the map and provide a label.
Not required, but additional exercises include the following: displaying the route (either recommended/computed or plot of a past route, etc.), switching to 3D view, street view, etc., linking to other resources such as restaurant reviews, etc.
